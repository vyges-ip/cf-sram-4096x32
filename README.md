## Consumers

soc-generator's `vendor_ips.py` resolves this mirror by version tag for any soc-spec.yaml that declares a matching `vendor_macros[]` entry. Downstream:

```bash
git clone --branch CF_SRAM_4096x32-v1.0.2 https://github.com/vyges-ip/cf-sram-4096x32 <target>/ip/CF_SRAM_4096x32
```

## How to bump the pinned release

1. Edit `upstream.yaml` → `upstream.version`
2. Push — the sync workflow runs automatically and pulls the new tag.

See [`upstream.yaml` schema](https://github.com/vyges/vyges-ip-internal/blob/main/upstream/upstream-yaml.schema.json) for the full field reference.
